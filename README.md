# MyHikes

https://rubenstein-my-hikes.herokuapp.com/

## Description

MyHikes is designed for all levels of hikers to record both the hikes they've completed and the hikes they wish to try in the future.  The home page includes some links (to be updated to an on-site feature at a later time) to find hikes.

This app is designed for high usability.  Most hiking websites, similar to booking flights, are more complicated than they need to be and a user can get easily frustrated and leave the site. The purpose of this app is for anyone to quickly update their personal hikes or find a hike they want to try.

### Obstacles

- I spent so much time working with user authentication through Google, and failing at it, that I ran out of time to inlcude any user login at all.  This will be something I finish as soon as possible.

- Using APIs to find hikes to post on the website directly was another casualty of the time-crunch.
